# P4_To-develop-a-CNN-model-to-classify-images-of-plastic-waste-into-different-categories-
This project aims to classify images of plastic waste into different categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset containing images of recyclable and organic waste. The objective is to automate the classification of waste for efficient recycling, contributing to waste management solutions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Waste Classification" dataset, which can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data).
